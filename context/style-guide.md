# **A Strategic Style Guide for Recruiting & Workforce Planning SaaS**

## **I. Foundational Principles: Defining Our Voice and Personality**

The foundation of any durable and trusted brand is a consistent and authentic identity. For a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform in the recruiting and workforce planning sector, this identity is communicated most directly through its language. The words used in the user interface, documentation, and marketing materials are not merely functional; they are a direct reflection of the product's core philosophy on hiring, talent, and human potential. This section establishes the foundational principles of our communication: a core voice that defines our unchanging personality, a spectrum of tones that adapt to user context, and a clear mission that guides every piece of content we create.

### **A. Core Voice Attributes: The Unchanging Personality**

The brand voice represents the core, stable personality of the product. It is the consistent character that users come to recognize and trust across all interactions. Analysis of leading technology companies reveals a sophisticated approach to defining this voice, moving beyond simple adjectives to create a framework of choices and boundaries. Atlassian, for example, defines its voice through the personality traits of "bold," "optimistic," and "practical, with a wink," treating the brand as a helpful, trend-aware colleague who understands the nuances of professional interaction.1 Mailchimp establishes a voice that is "plainspoken," "genuine," and a "translator" of complex topics, a character rooted in its origins as a small business that values empathy and clarity over "hyperbolic language, upsells, and over-promises".2

Perhaps most strategically, recruiting software leader Greenhouse communicates a voice that is "Bold," "Confident," "Purposeful," "Expert," "Smart," and "Supportive." Crucially, each attribute is paired with a negative constraint (e.g., "Bold not aggressive," "Expert not arrogant") to provide clear, actionable boundaries for all content creators.4 Similarly, while not a formal voice guide, the company values of AI leader Anthropic—such as "Do the simple thing that works" and "Be helpful, honest, and harmless"—directly inform a voice that must be trustworthy, empirical, and mission-driven.5

Drawing from these best practices and tailoring them to the specific needs of the recruiting domain, the following three core attributes will define our brand voice:

* **Expert:** We convey confidence, credibility, and deep domain knowledge in talent acquisition and workforce planning. Our content is authoritative, providing genuine insights that help users become more effective and strategic in their roles. This approach avoids arrogance, focusing instead on delivering verifiable, data-driven guidance that builds user trust in both our content and our platform's capabilities. This aligns directly with Greenhouse's "Expert not arrogant" principle, which is critical in a data-sensitive field where credibility is paramount.4  
* **Empowering:** Our language inspires action and builds user confidence. We position ourselves as a supportive partner in the user's professional journey, not merely a passive tool. The content should feel encouraging, motivating users to adopt best practices and leverage the platform to its full potential. This principle echoes Atlassian's goal to "Empower to inspire action" and Greenhouse's "Supportive not reliant" stance, which emphasizes a collaborative partnership over a directive relationship.1  
* **Clear:** We prioritize clarity above all. In a field often filled with jargon and complexity, we serve as "translators," demystifying complex processes and data. We use simple, direct language and avoid ambiguity. This commitment to clarity is a universal principle of excellence in technical and product communication, championed by organizations like Mailchimp ("plainspoken"), Google ("simple words and sentences"), and Microsoft ("crisp and clear").2

For a platform in the recruiting space, these voice attributes are more than just a communication style; they are an extension of the product's core value proposition. A voice that is consistently Expert, Empowering, and Clear implicitly communicates a product philosophy rooted in structured, fair, and intelligent hiring. Any deviation from these principles in the UI—such as confusing copy (not Clear) or condescending instructions (not Empowering)—risks undermining the user's trust in the platform's ability to facilitate an equitable and effective hiring process. Therefore, this voice is a strategic asset that reinforces the product's fundamental purpose.

### **B. Tone Spectrum: Adapting the Attitude to the Context**

While voice is the consistent personality, tone is the adaptable emotional inflection applied to that voice. As Mailchimp and Uber articulate, tone must change based on the user's context, emotional state, and the communication channel.3 A critical error message should not share the same enthusiastic tone as a feature announcement or a success notification. Establishing a clear spectrum for our key tones allows for this necessary flexibility while maintaining the integrity of our core voice.

This involves defining "tone levers" that can be adjusted along a continuum, similar to Uber's model of "enthusiastic ↔ matter-of-fact" and "light ↔ serious".8 Based on the common user journeys within a recruiting SaaS platform, the following tone spectrums are established:

* **Guiding ↔ Direct:**  
  * **Guiding:** In contexts like user onboarding, help documentation, or introducing a new feature, the tone is patient, encouraging, and supportive. The language is crafted to build confidence and reduce cognitive load for users learning a new workflow.  
  * **Direct:** In situations requiring immediate user attention, such as critical error messages, security alerts, or compliance warnings, the tone is unambiguous, precise, and matter-of-fact. It eliminates fluff to provide the user with the essential information needed to understand and resolve the issue quickly.  
* **Enthusiastic ↔ Matter-of-fact:**  
  * **Enthusiastic:** For marketing communications, celebrating user milestones (e.g., a successful hire, a diversity goal met), and announcing positive product updates, the tone is energetic and celebratory. It reinforces the value the user is getting from the product and shares in their success.  
  * **Matter-of-fact:** For technical documentation, API specifications, billing information, and data-heavy reports, the tone is objective, neutral, and precise. It prioritizes accuracy and clarity over emotional engagement, respecting the user's need for unadorned information.  
* **Human ↔ Formal:**  
  * **Human:** In most UX copy, support interactions, and empty states, the tone is conversational and relatable. It uses contractions and straightforward language to create a more natural and less robotic user experience, aligning with SAP Concur's principle of being "conversational, but not too casual or unprofessional".9  
  * **Formal:** In legal documents such as terms of service, privacy policies, and official compliance statements, the tone is more formal and legally precise. This ensures clarity and avoids ambiguity in high-stakes communications.

To operationalize these concepts, the following matrix provides a practical, quick-reference tool for applying the correct tone in critical user-journey moments. It maps common scenarios and user emotions to the appropriate tonal response, providing concrete examples that maintain our core voice.

| Context / User Feeling | Voice Attribute | Tone to Adopt | Example Snippet (Do / Don't) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **First-time User Onboarding** (Curious, Hopeful) | Empowering | Guiding, Human, Encouraging | **Do:** "Let's connect your first data source to see the magic happen." **Don't:** "You must configure the integration before proceeding." |
| **Critical Error Message** (Frustrated, Stressed) | Clear | Direct, Matter-of-fact, Helpful | **Do:** "Couldn't save changes. Please check your connection and try again." **Don't:** "Error 503: Write operation failed." |
| **Successful Candidate Hire** (Proud, Accomplished) | Empowering | Enthusiastic, Celebratory | **Do:** "Congratulations\! You've hired a new team member. Let's start their onboarding." **Don't:** "Candidate status has been updated to 'Hired'." |
| **API Documentation** (Focused, Technical) | Expert | Direct, Matter-of-fact, Formal | **Do:** "The candidateId parameter is required for this endpoint." **Don't:** "You should probably send the candidate ID." |
| **DE\&I Report Insight** (Analytical, Responsible) | Expert | Matter-of-fact, Insightful | **Do:** "This report shows a 10% increase in applicants from underrepresented groups this quarter." **Don't:** "Your diversity numbers are looking good\!" |

### **C. Content Mission & Goals: Defining Our Purpose**

Every piece of content, from the smallest tooltip to the most comprehensive whitepaper, must serve a clear and strategic purpose. This requires a well-defined content mission that aligns with both business objectives and user needs. Mailchimp's content goals—"Empower, Respect, Educate, Guide, Speak truth"—provide an excellent framework for ensuring user-centricity.2 This approach compels content creators to ask critical questions before writing: "What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?".2

Adopting and tailoring this framework, our content mission is as follows:

**Our Content Mission Statement:** *To provide recruiting and workforce planning professionals with the clearest, most empowering information to help them build exceptional teams. Our content transforms complex data into actionable insights, respects our users' time and intelligence, and guides them toward making fairer, smarter hiring decisions.*

This mission directly connects to business value. A clear content mission, as articulated by marketing and brand experts, is fundamental to building brand recognition, fostering user trust, and creating a consistent identity.10 In a competitive SaaS market, content that consistently delivers on this mission becomes a key differentiator, turning the product into a trusted resource and an indispensable partner in the user's professional success.

## **II. Content & Messaging Guidelines: The Words We Use**

This section transitions from high-level principles to the tactical, day-to-day rules of writing. It is designed to be the most frequently referenced part of the style guide, providing a single source of truth for grammar, mechanics, UI copy, AI-related communication, and inclusive language. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure that all written communication is clear, consistent, and reflective of our brand's core identity.

### **A. Grammar and Mechanics: The Rules of the Road**

Consistency in grammar and mechanics is the bedrock of professional, high-quality communication. These seemingly small details collectively build user trust, enhance readability, and create a polished user experience.

* **Punctuation:**  
  * **Serial (Oxford) Comma:** The use of the Oxford comma in a series of three or more items is mandatory. This practice is a standard in technical and UI writing as it eliminates ambiguity. Its use is explicitly required by major technology style guides, including those from Atlassian and Microsoft.7  
  * **Periods in UI:** Following modern UI conventions, periods will be omitted from titles, headings, labels, and short list items (three or fewer words). Periods will be used for complete sentences within body copy, paragraphs, and detailed descriptions.7  
  * **Dashes and Hyphens:** Clear distinctions will be maintained between hyphens (-), en dashes (–), and em dashes (—). Hyphens are used for compound modifiers (e.g., "fast-moving candidate"). En dashes are used for ranges (e.g., "5–10 years of experience"). Em dashes—without spaces on either side—are used to set off parenthetical phrases. These rules, drawn from established guides like Google's and Atlassian's, ensure typographical correctness and clarity.6  
* **Capitalization:**  
  * **Sentence Case:** The default capitalization style for all UI elements—including titles, headings, buttons, and labels—will be sentence case. In sentence case, only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized. This approach is the prevailing standard for modern, user-friendly interfaces and is recommended by Atlassian, Microsoft, and SAP Fiori.13  
  * **Title Case:** The use of title case (capitalizing the first letter of most words) is reserved for highly formal contexts, such as the titles of official published reports or whitepapers. Its use in the product UI is prohibited to maintain consistency.  
  * **Races and Ethnicities:** In line with best practices for inclusive communication, all racial and ethnic identifiers will be capitalized (e.g., "Black," "Asian," "Hispanic," "Indigenous"). This follows the standard set by leading platforms like Greenhouse.16  
* **Voice and Tense:**  
  * **Active Voice:** All writing will use the active voice. The active voice ("The system sends a notification") is more direct, concise, and easier to understand than the passive voice ("A notification is sent by the system"). This is a universal rule for effective communication, emphasized by Mailchimp and Google.2  
  * **Present Tense:** Product behavior, instructions, and technical documentation will be described using the present tense. This makes the information feel immediate, relevant, and directly applicable to the user's current actions.6

### **B. UI and UX Writing: Crafting the User Experience**

This subsection details specific patterns for writing copy within the product's user interface. The primary objective is to create an experience that feels intuitive, predictable, and helpful, reducing cognitive load and empowering users to achieve their goals efficiently.

* **Focus on User Action, Not UI Elements:** The core principle of our UX writing is to center the language on the user's goals, not the interface's mechanics. This follows Microsoft's well-established guideline: "Avoid talking about UI elements. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do".15  
  * **Example:** Instead of writing, "Click the 'Save' button to save your changes," the instruction will be, "Save your changes." This subtle shift empowers the user by focusing on their intent and outcome.  
* **Button and Call-to-Action (CTA) Copy:**  
  * **Verb-Led and Specific:** All button and CTA labels must begin with a strong, specific verb that clearly describes the action the user is about to take. Generic labels like "Submit," "Click," or "OK" are forbidden.  
  * **Clarity of Outcome:** The text must communicate the consequence of the action. For instance, "Create Report" is superior to "Go." SAP Fiori's design system provides an excellent reference list of precise verbs for common actions such as Add (to add an existing item to a list), Create (to make a new item from scratch), and Copy (to duplicate an item).14  
* **Empty States and Onboarding Text:**  
  * **Helpful Empty States:** An empty state (e.g., a project with no candidates) must be treated as an opportunity to guide the user. The copy should explain the value of the feature, clarify why the state is currently empty, and provide a clear, actionable next step to populate it.  
  * **Empowering Onboarding:** Onboarding copy will adhere strictly to the principles defined in the Voice & Tone Matrix. It should be guiding, human, and encouraging, making the user feel capable and supported as they learn the platform.  
* **Error Messages and Notifications:**  
  * **The 3-Part Error Message:** All error messages must be clear, human, and helpful. They will follow a three-part structure:  
    1. **What happened:** A simple, plain-language statement of the problem.  
    2. **Why it happened (if known):** A brief, non-technical explanation of the cause.  
    3. **What to do next:** A clear, actionable instruction for the user to resolve the issue.  
  * This structure ensures messages are never dead ends and aligns with our core voice attributes of being "Clear" and "Empowering".9  
* **Labels, Placeholders, and Tooltips:**  
  * **Labels:** Form field labels must be concise, descriptive, and written in sentence case.  
  * **Placeholder Text:** Placeholder text within an input field should offer a brief example of the required format or content (e.g., "example@company.com"). It must not be used as a replacement for a persistent label, as this creates significant accessibility issues.  
  * **Tooltips:** Tooltips should provide brief, non-essential, contextual help. Critical information required to complete a task must never be hidden within a tooltip.

### **C. Writing for and about AI Features: The New Frontier**

Effectively communicating the capabilities and interactions of Artificial Intelligence is a critical competency for any modern SaaS product. This requires a new set of guidelines that go beyond traditional UX writing to encompass the unique dynamics of human-AI collaboration. The principles established by AI leaders like Google and Anthropic provide a robust foundation.

A significant evolution in this space is the shift from "prompt engineering" to "context engineering." While prompt engineering focuses on tweaking a single instruction, context engineering, a concept advanced by Anthropic, involves providing the AI with the right holistic state, tools, and background information to achieve a desired outcome.17 This represents a more sophisticated and effective model for interaction. Our style guide must therefore focus not just on the words a user types, but on how our product helps them construct this necessary context.

* **Principles of Human-to-AI Communication:** Our documentation and in-app guidance will be structured to teach users a new skill: how to effectively collaborate with our AI. This involves incorporating principles from Google Gemini's prompt design strategies 18:  
  * **Be Clear and Specific:** Educate users on the importance of providing detailed instructions and relevant context in their requests.  
  * **Use Few-Shot Examples:** Where possible, the UI should facilitate "few-shot prompting" by allowing users to provide examples of the desired output, a technique proven to regulate formatting, phrasing, and scope.18  
  * **Decompose Complex Tasks:** The product and its documentation should encourage users to break down large, complex requests (e.g., "Source candidates for a senior engineering role") into a series of smaller, chained prompts (e.g., 1\. "Draft a job description," 2\. "Identify key skills," 3\. "Search for profiles with these skills").  
* **Communicating with AI Agents:** As AI features become more agentic—capable of performing multi-step tasks autonomously—our UI language must provide radical transparency.  
  * **Setting Expectations:** We must be explicit about the AI's capabilities and limitations. Google's documentation wisely cautions against relying on models for generating factual information or solving complex logic problems, a principle we must adopt.18  
  * **Visualizing the "Chain of Thought":** When an AI agent is working on a task, the interface should clearly communicate its process. Anthropic's concept of revealing the model's "chain of thought" is a powerful UX pattern that builds trust and allows for user intervention.19 The UI copy will narrate the agent's actions (e.g., "Now searching for profiles on LinkedIn," "Next, summarizing the top 5 candidates").  
* **Avoiding Anthropomorphism:** While our brand tone is "Human," it is critical to avoid misrepresenting the AI as a sentient being. The AI will be referred to by its feature name (e.g., "the Candidate Matcher"), or as "the model" or "the system." We will never use personal pronouns ("he," "she") or language that implies consciousness. This maintains transparency and manages user expectations appropriately.

This entire section of the style guide represents a strategic asset. By externalizing these principles into tutorials, help documentation, and in-app guidance, we can transform a potential point of user friction (learning to use AI) into a source of empowerment and product differentiation. This positions the product not just as a tool, but as an expert partner that helps users master the future of recruiting.

### **D. Inclusive Communication: Writing for Everyone**

For a product in the recruiting and workforce planning domain, inclusive communication is a non-negotiable, core feature. The language we use must reflect and reinforce a commitment to fair, equitable, and unbiased hiring practices. Failure to do so directly undermines the product's credibility and value proposition. We will therefore adopt a comprehensive and proactive approach to inclusivity, using the guidelines from industry leader Greenhouse as a primary model.16

* **Foundational Pillars of Inclusive Language:**  
  * **Person-First Language:** Our writing will always focus on the person, not their characteristics. For example, we will use "people with disabilities" instead of "the disabled," and "a candidate who is blind" instead of "a blind candidate." This principle, also advocated by Mailchimp, emphasizes respect and humanity.2  
  * **Gender Neutrality:** Gender-neutral language will be the default for all communications. This includes using neutral alternatives for job titles (e.g., "server" instead of "waitress," "salesperson" instead of "salesman") and using the singular "they" as the standard pronoun for a person of unspecified gender.2  
  * **Race and Ethnicity:** We will capitalize all racial and ethnic groups (e.g., Black, Asian, Latino, White) and use specific, preferred terminology. We will be mindful that terms like "Hispanic" and "Latino/Latina/Latinx" are not interchangeable and should be used with an understanding of their distinct meanings.16  
  * **Age and Disability:** Age-related descriptors such as "young," "old," or "elderly" will be avoided. A person's age or disability will not be mentioned unless it is directly relevant to the content being presented.2  
* **Maintaining a "No-Fly List" for Biased Language:** We will create and maintain an internal list of words and phrases to avoid. This list, inspired by Greenhouse's guidelines, will include terms that may carry unconscious bias, ableist connotations, or exclusionary historical baggage. Examples include militaristic metaphors ("war for talent"), ableist idioms ("turn a blind eye"), and potentially loaded terms like "world-class" or "rockstar" that can deter diverse candidates.7  
* **Content Accessibility as a Standard:** Inclusivity extends beyond word choice to the accessibility of the content itself.  
  * **Alternative Text:** All images must include descriptive alt text that clearly conveys the image's content and purpose for users of screen readers.16  
  * **Readability:** We will prioritize readability by using short sentences, concise paragraphs, and clear headings. Following Greenhouse's recommendation, we will aim for a maximum line length of 70–80 characters where feasible to improve scannability and reduce cognitive strain.16  
  * **Descriptive Link Text:** Hyperlink text must be descriptive of its destination. Instead of generic phrases like "click here" or "learn more," the link text will describe the content it leads to (e.g., "Read our complete guide to structured hiring"). This provides crucial context for users of assistive technologies.

By embedding these inclusive practices into our content creation process, we ensure that our product not only functions as a tool for equitable hiring but also communicates and embodies those values in every user interaction.

## **III. Visual & Brand Identity Guidelines**

A cohesive brand identity is built on the consistent application of visual elements. This section provides clear guidelines for the use of logos, colors, typography, and other visual assets. The goal is to create a recognizable, professional, and accessible visual language that complements our brand voice and enhances the user experience. These guidelines draw inspiration from the meticulous and well-documented design systems of companies like Stripe, Workday, and Shopify's Polaris.

### **A. Logo Usage: The Core Brand Mark**

The company logo is the most sacred and recognizable visual asset. Its consistent and correct application is vital for building brand equity.

* **Primary Logo and Wordmark:**  
  * The full wordmark is the primary logo to be used in most contexts. When placed on a light background, the approved brand color (e.g., green or dark green, as seen with Greenhouse) should be used. When on a dark background, the wordmark must be reversed to white.21  
  * **Clear Space:** A minimum clear space must be maintained around the logo to ensure its visibility and impact. This space is typically defined relative to the logo's size, such as one-half the height of the logo icon, as specified by Apple.22 No other text, images, or graphic elements should intrude upon this area.  
  * **Minimum Size:** To maintain legibility, a minimum size for digital and print applications will be established. For example, Workday specifies a digital minimum width of 102px for its logo.23  
* **Icon and "Dub" Usage:**  
  * An icon or shorthand version of the logo (like Greenhouse's "g" icon or Workday's "Dub") can be used in contexts where space is limited, such as favicons, application icons, or social media avatars.21  
  * The icon should never be used as a purely decorative element and must always be clearly associated with the brand.  
* **Logo Don'ts:** The integrity of the logo must be protected at all times. The following alterations are strictly prohibited, as outlined by Greenhouse and Apple 21:  
  * Do not distort, stretch, or rotate the logo.  
  * Do not use unapproved colors or apply gradients, patterns, or effects like drop shadows.  
  * Do not outline the logo.  
  * Do not place the logo on a visually cluttered or patterned background that compromises its legibility.

### **B. Color Palette: The Language of Hues**

Color is a powerful tool for creating visual hierarchy, conveying meaning, and ensuring brand consistency. Our color system will be built on a foundation of primary, secondary, and semantic colors, defined as design tokens for scalable and consistent implementation.

* **Primary and Secondary Colors:**  
  * A primary brand color palette will be defined, including a main brand color (e.g., Greenhouse Green), a darker shade for text and accents (e.g., Evergreen), and a set of vibrant secondary colors for illustrations and highlights (e.g., Marigold, Zinnia, Iris).21  
  * These colors will be specified with their RGB, CMYK, Hex, and Pantone values to ensure consistency across all digital and print media.  
* **Semantic (UI) Colors:** A specific set of colors will be designated for UI states to communicate meaning consistently and accessibly. This practice is central to design systems like Stripe's.24  
  * **info:** A neutral color (e.g., blue) for informational messages and highlights.  
  * **success:** A positive color (e.g., green) to indicate the successful completion of an action.  
  * **attention / warning:** An alert color (e.g., yellow or orange) for warnings that require user attention.  
  * **critical / destructive:** An urgent color (e.g., red) for error messages, critical alerts, and destructive actions (like deletion).  
* **Neutral and Background Colors:** A palette of neutral grays and whites will be defined for backgrounds, containers, borders, and text.  
  * **Backgrounds:** A base background color (e.g., surface) and a slightly darker container color (e.g., container) will be used to create visual depth, following Stripe's model.24  
  * **Text:** A primary color (e.g., dark gray) will be used for most text, with a secondary, lighter gray for less prominent text to create a clear visual hierarchy.24  
  * **Borders/Keylines:** A neutral border color (keyline) will be used to delineate components.24  
* **Accessibility and Contrast:** All color combinations, especially for text and its background, must meet WCAG AA accessibility standards for contrast. This is a non-negotiable requirement to ensure our product is usable by everyone. Tools will be used to verify contrast ratios for all primary, secondary, and semantic color pairings.

### **C. Typography: The Voice Made Visible**

Typography gives visual form to our brand voice. Our typographic system will be designed for clarity, readability, and hierarchy across all devices.

* **Font Family:** A primary font family will be selected for all brand communications. It should be a versatile font with a range of weights (e.g., Regular, Medium, Bold) to allow for clear typographic hierarchy. While some brands like Apple use custom fonts (Myriad Set), it is often more practical and accessible to use a widely available web font from a service like Google Fonts.22  
* **Typographic Scale and Hierarchy:** A consistent typographic scale will be established to define styles for different text elements. This ensures visual harmony and helps users scan information effectively. Stripe's system provides a clear model 24:  
  * **heading:** For main page titles and section headers.  
  * **subheading:** For secondary headers and important labels.  
  * **body:** The default style for all paragraph text.  
  * **caption:** For smaller, less prominent text like help text or metadata.  
* **Line Spacing (Leading):** Proper line spacing is crucial for readability. We will establish rules for line height based on the text size, following Greenhouse's formulaic approach 21:  
  * **Headline:** Line spacing \= 1.0x font size.  
  * **Subhead:** Line spacing \= 1.27x font size.  
  * **Body Copy:** Line spacing \= 1.3x font size.  
* **Text Handling:**  
  * **Wrapping and Truncation:** The default behavior for text that overflows its container will be to wrap to the next line. Truncation with an ellipsis (…) should be avoided whenever possible and used only as a last resort in space-constrained UI elements like tables or narrow sidebars.13  
  * **Text Transformation:** The text-transform property (e.g., uppercase) should be used sparingly, primarily for specific UI elements like tags or badges, to avoid compromising readability.24

### **D. Imagery and Iconography: Communicating Visually**

Photography, illustrations, and icons play a critical role in creating an engaging and human-centered brand experience. They must align with our brand voice and our commitment to inclusivity.

* **Photography Principles:** Our brand photography should feel authentic, professional, and inspiring. Greenhouse provides an excellent set of principles that we will adopt 21:  
  * **Confident and Focused:** Subjects should appear driven, passionate, and engaged, not passive or staged.  
  * **Natural and Authentic:** Settings should look like real workplaces, not artificial sets. Natural light is preferred.  
  * **Warm and Inspiring:** The overall mood should be welcoming and friendly, depicting professionals that users can aspire to be.  
  * **Diversely Human:** Photography must reflect the diversity of the global workforce. It is imperative to showcase people of different races, genders, body types, ages, and abilities in a realistic and respectful manner. This is a core tenet of our inclusive communication strategy.16  
* **Iconography:**  
  * **Style:** A single, consistent icon style (e.g., line, solid, duotone) will be used throughout the product. The icons should be clear, simple, and easily recognizable.  
  * **Usage:** Icons should be used to support text labels, not replace them, unless the icon's meaning is universally understood (e.g., a gear icon for settings).  
  * **Color:** UI icons should typically inherit their color from the surrounding text (color: primary or secondary). Semantic colors (success, critical, etc.) can be used to convey status.24

## **IV. Technical & Platform Guidelines**

This section provides guidelines for the technical implementation of our product's front-end, documentation, and API design. Consistency in these areas is crucial for creating a seamless developer experience, ensuring maintainability, and building a platform that is both robust and easy to use. The principles outlined here are drawn from the best practices of leading developer-first companies like Google, Stripe, and Anthropic.

### **A. Code and API Documentation: The Developer's Guide**

High-quality documentation is a core feature of any successful SaaS platform. It builds trust with developers, accelerates integration, and reduces the support burden. Our documentation will adhere to the rigorous standards set by the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide.6

* **Reference Hierarchy:** When questions of style or grammar arise, we will follow a clear hierarchy of sources 6:  
  1. **This Style Guide:** Our internal guide is the primary source of truth.  
  2. **Google Developer Documentation Style Guide:** For technical style questions not covered here.  
  3. **Third-Party References:** For general spelling (Merriam-Webster.com) and non-technical style (The Chicago Manual of Style).  
* **Structure of API Documentation:**  
  * **Clear Endpoints:** Each endpoint will be clearly documented with its HTTP method, path, a concise description of its function, and any required permissions.  
  * **Parameters:** All request parameters (path, query, and body) will be listed in a table with their name, data type, a description of their purpose, and whether they are required or optional.  
  * **Code Samples:** Every endpoint will include practical, copy-paste-ready code samples in multiple popular programming languages. These samples should demonstrate a real-world use case.  
  * **Responses:** All possible success and error responses will be documented with their HTTP status codes and example response bodies.  
* **Language and Formatting in Code:**  
  * **Code in Text:** When referring to code elements (e.g., function names, parameters, filenames) in prose, they will be formatted using a monospaced font or backticks (e.g., the candidateId parameter).25  
  * **Placeholders:** Placeholder variables in code samples and syntax descriptions will be clearly distinguished, often using italics or a specific naming convention (e.g., your\_api\_key).25  
  * **Command-Line Syntax:** Instructions for command-line tools will be clear and unambiguous, with user-provided input clearly differentiated from the command itself.6

### **B. AI and Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**

As our platform incorporates AI and LLM features, our technical guidelines must extend to how these systems are integrated and presented to the user. This involves both API design and the structure of user-facing interactions.

* **Designing "Skills" and "Tools":** We will adopt Anthropic's model of "Skills" and "Tools" for our AI agents. A "Skill" is a self-contained set of instructions that teaches the AI how to perform a specific, repeatable task.19  
  * **Structure of a Skill:** Each skill will be defined in a simple, structured format (like a SKILL.md file) containing:  
    1. **YAML Frontmatter:** A name and a clear description of what the skill does and when it should be used.26  
    2. **Instructions:** The core logic and steps for the AI to follow.  
    3. **Examples:** Few-shot examples demonstrating correct usage and output.  
  * **Tool Design:** The tools our AI uses (e.g., APIs it can call) must be designed for "ergonomic" use by the agent. This means they should be efficient, return token-friendly information, and have clear, unambiguous descriptions.17  
* **Multi-Modal Input Handling:** As our platform evolves to handle multi-modal inputs (text, images, documents, video), we must establish and document clear technical specifications for these inputs. Google Gemini's guidelines provide a strong starting point 28:  
  * **Images:** Define maximum file size (e.g., 7 MB), supported MIME types (image/png, image/jpeg), and maximum number of images per prompt.  
  * **Documents:** Specify maximum file size (e.g., 50 MB for API), supported MIME types (application/pdf, text/plain), and page limits.  
  * **Video/Audio:** Establish limits on length, number of files, and supported formats.  
* **Model Parameters:** For advanced users interacting with our AI via an API, we will expose and document key model parameters, such as:  
  * **max\_output\_tokens:** Specifies the maximum number of tokens in the generated response, allowing users to control length and cost.18  
  * Other parameters like temperature and top\_p may be exposed to control the creativity and randomness of the output.

### **C. Component and Design System Architecture**

To ensure consistency and scalability, our front-end will be built using a component-based architecture, managed within a design system. This approach, championed by platforms like Shopify (Polaris), Workday (Canvas), and Stripe, treats UI elements as reusable, well-documented building blocks.30

* **Foundation in Design Tokens:** The visual styles (color, typography, spacing) will be defined as "design tokens." These are atomic pieces of style information stored as variables (e.g., \--color-brand-primary, \--font-size-body).33 This allows for easy theming and global style updates.  
  * Stripe's Appearance API is an excellent example of how tokens for fontFamily, colorPrimary, and spacingUnit can be used to broadly customize UI components.32  
* **Component Library:**  
  * **Reusable Components:** Our UI will be composed of a library of reusable components (e.g., Button, Input, Card, Modal). Each component will have a clear API (props) and documented usage guidelines.31  
  * **Styling:** Styling will be encapsulated within the components. We will follow a model similar to Stripe's, where foundational components like Box and Inline allow for custom CSS-in-JS styling using design tokens, while more complex components have preset styles to ensure consistency.24  
* **Layout System:** We will adopt a modern, predictable layout system. Instead of relying on ad-hoc CSS, we will use a structured approach, such as Stripe's "stack" concept, where Box components manage the layout (horizontal, vertical, layered), spacing (gap), and alignment of their children.24 This creates more maintainable and responsive interfaces.  
* **Accessibility (A11y) baked in:** Accessibility will not be an afterthought. Every component in our design system will be built and tested to meet WCAG AA standards. This includes proper use of semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where necessary, and full keyboard navigability.

## **V. Conclusions and Strategic Recommendations**

This comprehensive analysis of style guidelines from S-tier technology leaders and domain-specific SaaS companies provides a clear blueprint for establishing a durable, effective, and strategic brand identity. The research reveals that a style guide is far more than a simple set of rules for grammar and logo placement; it is a mission-critical document that codifies a product's core philosophy, shapes the user experience, and serves as a key driver of user trust and adoption.

The following strategic recommendations synthesize the key findings of this report into an actionable plan for creating the style-guide.md file:

1\. Position the Style Guide as a Core Product Document, Not a Marketing Asset.  
The most significant conclusion from this research is that for a SaaS product in a sensitive domain like recruiting, the brand voice is an integral part of the product's value proposition. A voice that is Expert, Empowering, and Clear directly reinforces a commitment to fair, structured, and intelligent hiring. The style guide should therefore be managed with the same rigor as the product's source code—version-controlled, subject to review, and treated as a single source of truth for product managers, designers, engineers, and marketers alike.  
2\. Adopt a "System of Choices" Framework for Voice and Tone.  
Leading brands define their voice not with a static list of adjectives, but with a dynamic framework of choices and boundaries (e.g., Greenhouse's "Bold not aggressive"). It is recommended to formally adopt the proposed core voice attributes—Expert, Empowering, Clear—and the adaptable tone spectrums—Guiding ↔ Direct, Enthusiastic ↔ Matter-of-fact, Human ↔ Formal. The Voice & Tone Matrix should be the centerpiece of this section, providing a practical, at-a-glance tool for ensuring contextual appropriateness in all communications.  
3\. Bifurcate the Guide to Address Both Human-to-Human and Human-to-AI Communication.  
A modern style guide for an AI-powered product must address two distinct communication paradigms. The first, "Human-to-Human," covers traditional UX writing, documentation, and marketing copy. The second, and more strategically important, is "Human-to-AI." This section should not focus on grammar, but on teaching users the mental models for effective AI interaction, drawing directly from the principles of context engineering and structured prompting pioneered by Anthropic and Google.  
4\. Externalize Human-to-AI Guidelines as a User Empowerment Tool.  
The "Human-to-AI Communication" section should be designed with the explicit goal of being repurposed into public-facing tutorials, help documentation, and in-app guidance. By teaching users how to effectively instruct the platform's AI features, the product can dramatically increase user success, reduce frustration, and demonstrate superior value. This transforms the style guide from an internal cost center into a strategic asset for user onboarding, adoption, and retention.  
5\. Make Inclusive Communication a Non-Negotiable, Auditable Standard.  
Given the product's domain, a commitment to inclusive communication is a fundamental requirement for market credibility. The guidelines outlined in Section II.D, modeled on Greenhouse's best-in-class approach, should be implemented immediately. This includes establishing a "no-fly list" for biased language, mandating person-first language, and ensuring all content and visual assets are accessible and representative of a diverse global workforce. This commitment should be regularly audited to ensure compliance.  
6\. Build the Front-End on a Scalable Design System Rooted in Tokens.  
To ensure visual and interactive consistency, the product's front-end architecture must be based on a formal design system, following the models of Stripe, Workday, and Shopify. The foundation of this system should be a well-defined set of design tokens for color, typography, and spacing. This approach will accelerate development, simplify maintenance, and ensure that the user experience remains cohesive and professional as the product scales.  
By implementing these recommendations, the resulting style-guide.md will serve not only as a rulebook but as a strategic charter. It will align the entire organization around a unified vision for communication, ensuring that every word and pixel works in concert to build a trusted, authoritative, and indispensable platform for the future of recruiting and workforce planning.
