### Voice Attributes (Never Change)

- **Clear** (not ambiguous) - Simple, direct, jargon-free

### Tone Matrix (Adapt to Context)

|--------------|------|---------|
| Curious (onboarding) | Guiding, Human, Encouraging | "Let's connect your first data source to see the magic happen." |
| Frustrated (error) | Direct, Matter-of-fact, Helpful | "Couldn't save changes. Please check your connection and try again." |

| Technical (API docs) | Direct, Matter-of-fact, Formal | "The candidateId parameter is required for this endpoint." |

### Grammar Quick Rules
- ‚úÖ Oxford comma: "candidates, skills, and jobs"

### AI Communication Principles
1. **Be Clear and Specific** - Detailed instructions, relevant context
2. **Use Few-Shot Examples** - Show desired output format
3. **Decompose Complex Tasks** - Break into smaller, chained prompts
4. **Visualize Chain of Thought** - Show what the agent is doing
5. **Avoid Anthropomorphism** - Refer to "the model" or "the system", never "he/she"
